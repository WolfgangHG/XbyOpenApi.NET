This package contains a .NET client for the X / Twitter REST api.

This client was generated with Kiota based on the OpenAPI description at https://api.twitter.com/2/openapi.json

Don't reference this package directly. The X REST api requires OAuth1 or OAuth2 authentication, 
which is handled by the packages [XbyOpenApi.OAuth1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/XbyOpenApi.OAuth1) and [XbyOpenApi.OAuth2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/XbyOpenApi.OAuth2). 
In a WinForms environment, you can use the packages [XbyOpenApi.OAuth1.WinForms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/XbyOpenApi.OAuth1.WinForms) and [XbyOpenApi.OAuth2.WinForms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/XbyOpenApi.OAuth2.WinForms),
which provide some UI to fetch access tokens interactively.
